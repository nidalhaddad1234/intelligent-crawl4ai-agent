## Tips for Best Results

### 1. Be Specific
```
Good: "Extract product names, prices in USD, and availability status"
Better: "Extract laptops with RAM >= 16GB, showing prices in USD and whether they're in stock"
```

### 2. Provide Context
```
Good: "Scrape this website"
Better: "I'm researching competitor pricing for electronics - please extract all product data from this website"
```

### 3. Use Natural Language
```
Not needed: "SCRAPE URL=https://... FORMAT=CSV FIELDS=name,price"
Just say: "Can you get the names and prices from this site and save as CSV?"
```

### 4. Ask for Clarification
```
You: How should I ask for data from password-protected sites?

AI: For password-protected sites, you can say something like:
"This site needs login - username is X and password is Y. Please extract the member directory."

I'll handle the authentication automatically.
```

## Error Handling

### Common Issues and Solutions

**"I don't understand your request"**
- Try rephrasing more naturally
- Add more context about what you want
- Break complex requests into steps

**"Website extraction failed"**
- The AI will automatically try alternative approaches
- You can provide hints: "This site loads data dynamically"
- Or specify requirements: "Make sure to wait for prices to load"

**"Export failed"**
- Check if data was extracted first
- Specify format clearly: "Export as Excel file"
- Ensure you have write permissions

## WebSocket Features

For real-time applications, connect via WebSocket:

```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8888/ws/session-id');

ws.onmessage = (event) => {
    const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
    console.log('AI says:', data.content);
};

ws.send(JSON.stringify({
    message: "Monitor this product page for price changes",
    urls: ["https://example.com/product"]
}));
```

## Customization

### Theme Options
The UI supports light/dark themes. Toggle with the theme button.

### Language Settings
Currently supports English. Multi-language support planned.

### Display Preferences
- Compact vs. Detailed responses
- Show/hide technical details
- Enable/disable emoji indicators

## Performance Tips

### For Faster Responses
1. Be direct with requests
2. Include URLs in the URL field
3. Use sessions for related requests
4. Enable caching in settings

### For Better Results
1. Let the AI learn from corrections
2. Provide feedback on results
3. Use consistent terminology
4. Build on previous requests

## Integration Examples

### Bookmark Integration
Save this bookmarklet for quick scraping:

javascript:(function(){
    window.open('http://localhost:8888?url=' + encodeURIComponent(window.location.href));
})();
```

### API Integration
See [API Documentation](api.md) for programmatic access.

## Security & Privacy

## Troubleshooting

### UI Not Loading
1. Check server is running: `python web_ui_server.py`
2. Verify port 8888 is available
3. Try different browser
4. Check console for errors

### Slow Responses
1. Check AI model is loaded: Visit http://localhost:8888/health
