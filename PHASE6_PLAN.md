# Next Phase: Enhanced Tool Capabilities

## Phase 6: Enhanced Tool Capabilities (Week 3-4)

Phase 6 focuses on making tools more intelligent and capable:

### Objectives:
- Dynamic parameter discovery
- Tool combination strategies  
- Performance profiling per tool
- Capability matching system
- Tool recommendation engine

### Implementation Plan:

1. **Dynamic Parameter Discovery**
   - Tools can suggest parameters based on input
   - Context-aware parameter validation
   - Optional vs required parameter handling

2. **Tool Combination Strategies**
   - AI learns which tools work well together
   - Automatic pipeline creation
   - Parallel vs sequential execution

3. **Performance Profiling**
   - Track execution time per tool
   - Memory usage monitoring
   - Success rate by parameter types
   - Cost analysis (API calls, resources)

4. **Capability Matching**
   - Semantic search for tool capabilities
   - "Find me a tool that can..." queries
   - Tool substitution recommendations

5. **Tool Recommendation Engine**
   - Suggest better tools for tasks
   - Recommend new tools to create
   - Identify capability gaps

### Ready to Start Phase 6!

With the learning system complete, the AI can now:
- Learn from every interaction
- Reuse successful patterns
- Avoid past mistakes
- Continuously improve

The next phase will make the tools themselves smarter and more capable!
