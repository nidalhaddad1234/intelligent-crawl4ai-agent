"""
Phase 5: Learning System - Implementation Plan

Build a system where AI learns from every interaction and improves over time.
"""

# OVERVIEW
"""
The Learning System will:
1. Record every user request and the AI's plan
2. Track success/failure of executions
3. Store patterns in ChromaDB for similarity matching
4. Learn from Claude (teacher) when confidence is low
5. Improve planning accuracy over time

    "1. [ ] Create ai_core/learning/memory.py",
    "2. [ ] Implement ChromaDB pattern storage",
    "3. [ ] Create ai_core/learning/trainer.py", 
    "4. [ ] Build pattern analysis functions",
    "5. [ ] Extend AIPlanner to AdaptivePlanner",
    "6. [ ] Add similarity search before planning",
    "7. [ ] Implement teacher consultation",
    "8. [ ] Add outcome recording to web UI",
    "9. [ ] Create learning statistics endpoint",
    "10. [ ] Build daily learning routine",

# EXAMPLE LEARNING FLOW
"""
User: "Extract product prices from Amazon"

1. Search ChromaDB for similar requests
   Found: "Scrape prices from e-commerce site" (0.92 similarity)
   
2. Check past success with this pattern
   Success rate: 94% with 'crawl_web' + 'analyze_content' tools
   
3. Adapt successful plan to new request
   - Use same tool sequence
   - Adjust parameters for Amazon
   
4. Execute and record outcome
   Success! Store as positive example
   
5. Over time, system learns:
   - Amazon needs specific CSS selectors
   - Anti-bot measures require delays
   - Best time to scrape is early morning
   
6. Future requests are faster and more accurate!
